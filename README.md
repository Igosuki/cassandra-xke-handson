=====================

A suite of exercices to learn Cassandra using a web application for use cases

Prerequisites

You can install Cassandra 1.2.2 from the main website, but for a nicer experience install the latest version of
datastax's cassandra community (1.2.2 at the time) and opscenter (3.0.1 at the time) (which are just cassandra with
nice tools bundled).

Note : I recommend using the 1.6 JDK to run if you want to run Cassandra using 1.7 JDK on MacOSX, use an updated version of snappy java :
http://code.google.com/p/snappy-java/downloads/detail?name=snappy-java-1.0.5-M2.jar&can=2&q=

Export the bins over to your environment path and let's get started.

Make sure cassandra, cassandra-cli, cqlsh, opscenter are working fine.
