In the video, all members of Bloc Party are at a nightclub (which is, in reality, Caf√© 1001, Dray Walk, Truman Brewery, London). It follows them throughout the night even though they do not appear to be doing much besides looking around. Okereke is the only one who actually gets up and goes around. The other members just sit around while Okereke goes off on his own journey, whilst cigarette burn effects and other visual distortions distort the film.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Bloc Party","artistMbid":"8c538f11-c141-4588-8ecb-931083524186","album":"A Weekend In The City","albumMbid":"00ef5e74-6546-4da4-8432-eb375e40b0e0","position":4,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":223,"location":null}
