It also contains references to the September 11 attacks and The Daily Mail. Band frontman Kele Okereke stated in an interview with Jolie Lash:\n \n     The 30 bus in Hackney, which is just around the corner from where I live, was blown up. [That song was] written when I was just observing the reactions of the mainstream press in [the UK] and I was just amazed at how easy it'd been to whip them up into a fury. ... I guess the point about the song for me is post-September 11th, the media has really traded on fear and the use of fear in controlling people.\n \n The opening of the song features sound portions from news programs into a catchy feel.\n \n \n Video\n \n The music video for the song &quot;Hunting for Witches&quot; is the most simplistic off the album so far. It simply features the band performing the song in a dark room, using some unique overhead shots in some parts of the video.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Bloc Party","artistMbid":"8c538f11-c141-4588-8ecb-931083524186","album":"A Weekend In The City","albumMbid":"00ef5e74-6546-4da4-8432-eb375e40b0e0","position":2,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":210,"location":null}
