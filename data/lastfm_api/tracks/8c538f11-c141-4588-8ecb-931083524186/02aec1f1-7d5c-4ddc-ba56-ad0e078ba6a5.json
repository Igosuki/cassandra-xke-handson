It portrays monkey scientists placing an assortment of body parts into a body. The resulting creature, which has a bull's head, a crab's pincer, and a hairy human body then rises in popularity among the world, eventually becoming the president of the United States. The entire time, the scientists are controlling it. Eventually, the creature (named Smith) goes to war with other countries to get bananas for the monkey scientists.
