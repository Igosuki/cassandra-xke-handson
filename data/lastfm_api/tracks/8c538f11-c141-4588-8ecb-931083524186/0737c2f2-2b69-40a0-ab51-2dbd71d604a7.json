The video was published on NME on 17 October 2007. Like the Beastie Boys music video &quot;Intergalactic&quot;, which it resembles stylistically, it pays homage to Japanese kaiju movies. It shows two giant silver robots falling in love while other monsters and robots destroy the city they are in. The band themselves do not appear in the video.\n \n The video was filmed over two days in Boston with American performance troupe Kaiju Big Battel. Some of the Kaiju (Japanese for 'strange beast') characters in the video are the Call-Me-Kevin, Grudyin, Unibouzo, Vegetius, Giii the Space Pirate and Steam-Powered Tentacle Boulder (the newest Kaiju Hero).\n \n \n B-side - &quot;Emma Kate's Accident&quot;, &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, &quot;Where Is Home?&quot;\n Released - 12 November 2007 (2007-11-12)\n Format - Digital download, CD, 7&quot; vinyl, 12&quot; vinyl\n Recorded - 2007 at The Garage\n Genre - Post-punk revival/Alternative Dance\n Length - 3:39\n Label - Witchita - WEBB135\n Writer(s) - Bloc Party\n Producer - Jacknife Lee\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Bloc Party","artistMbid":"8c538f11-c141-4588-8ecb-931083524186","album":"A Weekend In The City","albumMbid":"00ef5e74-6546-4da4-8432-eb375e40b0e0","position":10,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":215,"location":null}
