The song saw considerable success in the United States, where it was their only top ten pop hit; in the United Kingdom, however, the single only charted in the top twenty.\n \n The title of this song is widely disputed, as it varies between &quot;Lovesong&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot; on many official Cure releases. The artwork for the album Disintegration uses both: &quot;Love Song&quot; on the tracklisting and &quot;Lovesong&quot; on the lyrics sheet. When released as a single in 1989, the cover artwork displayed the title as &quot;Lovesong&quot;, while the printing on the disc itself read &quot;Love Song&quot; all three times. Subsequent releases of Paris and Galore both use &quot;Lovesong&quot; exclusively, whilst 2001's Greatest Hits compilation uses &quot;Lovesong&quot; on the tracklisting and &quot;Love Song&quot; within the liner notes. 2004's Join the Dots also uses &quot;Lovesong&quot; within the booklet presentation.\n \n Upon release as a single, the song received worldwide success, and first peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it the group's most successful single in the US to date. The song also charted at #2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, #27 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and #18 on the UK Singles Chart. Robert Smith originally wrote the song for his long-time girlfriend and then fianc√©e, Mary, as a wedding present.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"The Cure","artistMbid":"69ee3720-a7cb-4402-b48d-a02c366f2bcf","album":"Galore","albumMbid":"","position":7,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":207,"location":null}
