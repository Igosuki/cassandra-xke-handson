The band began the song with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Frusciante\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">John Frusciante</a> playing the opening riff, but didn't continue to play the rest of the song after <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+Kiedis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Anthony Kiedis</a> said into the microphone &quot;<em>Nah, not this one</em>&quot;. It was stated in reviews and the press that <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+Kiedis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Anthony Kiedis</a> was suffering from throat problems and that it affected some of his performances, which may have been a factor in why &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot; was not played.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","artistMbid":"8bfac288-ccc5-448d-9573-c33ea2aa5c30","album":"By the Way","albumMbid":"f2b8f8ef-c431-4bdc-b15d-2183b1bde3f7","position":6,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":231,"location":null}
