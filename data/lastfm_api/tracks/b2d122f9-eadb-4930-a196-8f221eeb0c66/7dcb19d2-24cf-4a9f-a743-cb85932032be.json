And apparently  it matters that &quot;no angel climbs down, only rain weeping on the grave, with a melody in the Wind/ Pneuma&quot;. We hear this &quot;on a Mortal Sunday as God's husbandry and the little heart of the child is saved&quot;. &quot;My heart beats no more, and on Earth the child sings&quot;. ?\n &quot;Hoppe Hoppe&quot; is from a nursery rhyme with the infant being bounced on the knees, like a horseback rider. \n By coincidence, most of the above vaguely happened when the Equestrian deity Pneuma (Wind) was used for the restoration of the Olympics' authority in 71AD in Rome, i.e. Jove (Good Father), Minerva (virgin sage career woman medic), Juno (mother role), Apollo (a bit like Jesus) were restored in a real-life Trojan revolution.\n \n The backing vocals in the chorus of this song are performed by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Khira+Li+Lindemann\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Khira Li Lindemann</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Z.+Kruspe\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Richard Z. Kruspe</a>'s daughter. She bears the last name &quot;Lindemann&quot; because her mother was previously married to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Till+Lindemann\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Till Lindemann</a> and kept this last name after their divorce. She got together with Kruspe and had Khira Li only after then.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Rammstein","artistMbid":"b2d122f9-eadb-4930-a196-8f221eeb0c66","album":"Mutter","albumMbid":"b18729d7-287e-4519-9397-b9f3e079cd3d","position":7,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":286,"location":null}
