But translates perfectly to &quot;I have no desire to&quot;.\n \n In the &quot;Keine Lust&quot; video, filmed in January 2005 and finally presented only a month later, the band is morbidly obese. The film appears to be a reunion with visibly aged band members and instruments that are clearly old and dusty. Out of all of the band members only keyboardist Flake appeared not to have gained any weight (because &quot;anything he doesn't want to do, he doesn't do&quot;, which includes eating). He arrives in a motorized wheelchair, just in time to play the keyboard part. At the end of the video, the rest of the band leaves, abandoning Flake who has managed to stand during the song and now cannot sit back down.\n \n The video was up for a nomination for the MTV European Music Awards in November 2005.\n \n On the video &quot;The Making of Keine Lust&quot;, guitarist Richard Kruspe discussed the meaning of the song and music video.\n \n         &quot;You know, after all of these years we're full-up! Fame, success, money. We don't want to do anything anymore! Nothing! That's the idea in the song. We've returned to the starting point again. We just want to make music again. We don't want all the circus that goes with it anymore. So, we meet up again, one more time, for one more performance- just to make music together. The fact that we are fat is just symbolic for excess. It's really just about returning to the beginning.&quot;\n \n It was first played in three consecutive concerts for members of the fan club, in October 2004. In the formal tour, it was played in every concert. Large columns of CO2 were part of the on stage show. The band played the song in the Echo Awards 2005, and they played dressed in the costumes used in the video. They even arrived on stage in the cars seen in the video. Currently, Keine Lust is the only song from Reise, Reise in the Liebe Ist FÃ¼r Alle Da tour setlist.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Rammstein","artistMbid":"b2d122f9-eadb-4930-a196-8f221eeb0c66","album":"Reise Reise","albumMbid":"","position":4,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":222,"location":null}
