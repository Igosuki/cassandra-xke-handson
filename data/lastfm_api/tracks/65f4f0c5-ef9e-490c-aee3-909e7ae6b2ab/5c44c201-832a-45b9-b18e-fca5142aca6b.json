It may be a reference to the film Sunset Boulevard. The line &quot;ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black,&quot; is probably an indirect reference to one of their earlier songs, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;.  The song was the first single from the album. It was written by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. ","wikiText":"&quot;The Memory Remains&quot; is a song by Metallica from their 1997 album ReLoad.
