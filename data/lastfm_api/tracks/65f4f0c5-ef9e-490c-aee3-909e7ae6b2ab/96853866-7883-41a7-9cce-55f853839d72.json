The protagonist of the story depicted within the song is an innocent man who is blamed for a crime he didn't do, and is executed via electrocution. It also features some of James Hetfield's highest note-singing (although they are screamed) and a lengthy guitar solo by Kirk Hammett, with lots of tapping at the beginning. It is also a downloaded song in the video game Rock Band.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Metallica","artistMbid":"65f4f0c5-ef9e-490c-aee3-909e7ae6b2ab","album":"Ride the Lightning","albumMbid":"51eb10e0-2b9e-3906-a8f1-db74b346cba5","position":2,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":397,"location":null}
