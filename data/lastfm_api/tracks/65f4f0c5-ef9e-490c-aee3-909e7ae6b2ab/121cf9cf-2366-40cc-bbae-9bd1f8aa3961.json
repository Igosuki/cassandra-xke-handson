","wikiText":"&quot;Trapped Under Ice” - song by American thrash metal band Metallica which appears on their album &quot;Ride the Lightning” from 1984.\n \n The song is 4:03 minutes long and is the shortest on the album, its composers are James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett. Inspiration to write the text of the song was the work of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. The text is written in first person who talks about what horror he is going through being trapped under the ice.\n \n This is one of the few songs from the album &quot;Ride the Lightning” which contains rapidly changing rhythms of songs in the style of previous album by Metallica, &quot;Kill ‘Em All”. This is also one of the rarely played songs by Metallica at concerts.\n \n Riff, which is heard at the beginning of the song was created by Kirk Hammett, when he was still a member of Exodus. He played the riff in demo song called &quot;Impaler” (which was later transformed and enclosed on the Exodus album, &quot;Tempo of the Damned”).\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Metallica","artistMbid":"65f4f0c5-ef9e-490c-aee3-909e7ae6b2ab","album":"Ride the Lightning","albumMbid":"51eb10e0-2b9e-3906-a8f1-db74b346cba5","position":5,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":244,"location":null}
