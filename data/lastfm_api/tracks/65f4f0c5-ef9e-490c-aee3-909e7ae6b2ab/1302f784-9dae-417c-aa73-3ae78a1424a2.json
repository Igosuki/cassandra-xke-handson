In 2004, Guitar Player listed James Hetfield's tone, most likely produced by an ESP guitar driving a Mesa Boogie amplifier as one of the &quot;50 Greatest Tones of All Time.&quot;[1]\n \n The lyrical theme of this song is dissociative identity disorder and schizophrenia, inspired by the 1978 Anthony Hopkins film Magic. James Hetfield sings from the point of view of an evil personality.[citation needed]\n \n &quot;Sad but True&quot; is one of six singles from Metallica. The song was included on Metallica's live collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Michael Kamen), entitled S&amp;M, as well as their 1993 box set Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Metallica","artistMbid":"65f4f0c5-ef9e-490c-aee3-909e7ae6b2ab","album":"The Metallica Collection","albumMbid":"","position":2,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":323,"location":null}
