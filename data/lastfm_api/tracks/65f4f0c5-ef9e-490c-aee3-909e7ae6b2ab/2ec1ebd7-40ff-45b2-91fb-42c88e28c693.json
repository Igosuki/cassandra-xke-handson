The song, following the control theme, rails against the military and the control it has over its soldiers. The soldier himself narrates the song during the verses and the soldier's superior narrates during the chorus. The song follows a similar musical style as most of the rest of the album, being at a frenetic pace and featuring many riffs and solos by Kirk Hammett.","wikiText":"Disposable Heroes is the fifth track of Metallica's 1986 album Master of Puppets. \n \n The song, following the control theme, rails against the military and the control it has over its soldiers.
