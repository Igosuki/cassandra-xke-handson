Hetfield's relationship with Christianity is well-established and stems from his mother's death because of her refusal to seek medical treatment for cancer because of her Christian Science beliefs. Religion is frequently discussed in other Metallica songs. In this song, the Leper Messiah of the title is someone who uses others' faith for their own personal gain and for control over them. After the first chorus, the narrator changes to a dissident of religion, asserts that religion is nothing but mental slavery and that those heading religions only do so for power and control. \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Metallica","artistMbid":"65f4f0c5-ef9e-490c-aee3-909e7ae6b2ab","album":"Master of Puppets","albumMbid":"88d2f13a-4d81-4551-ae96-60d7190f4591","position":6,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":340,"location":null}
