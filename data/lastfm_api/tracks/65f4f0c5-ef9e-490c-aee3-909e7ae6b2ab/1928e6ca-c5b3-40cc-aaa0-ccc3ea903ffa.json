Also, a major difference is the lack of melancholia and the sense of remorse, evident in its prequels, both lyrically and musically. It was not released as a single, as its predecessors were. A live version was performed for the first time on April 14, 2010 in Oslo, Norway.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Metallica","artistMbid":"65f4f0c5-ef9e-490c-aee3-909e7ae6b2ab","album":"Death Magnetic","albumMbid":"763b17bc-f5b1-4d42-bc19-98de8123c8b3","position":7,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":466,"location":null}
