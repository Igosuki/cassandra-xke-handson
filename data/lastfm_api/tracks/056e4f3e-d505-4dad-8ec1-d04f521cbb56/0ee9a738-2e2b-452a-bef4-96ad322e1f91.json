Whilst the single reached a moderately high chart position, many critics found the song overly repetitive. It prominently features sampled portions of &quot;Release the Beast&quot; performed by Breakwater.\n \n &quot;Robot Rock&quot; is based around a sample from the Breakwater song &quot;Release the Beast&quot;, which features a riff played on an oscillator sync patch on an analog synthesizer. In addition, Daft Punk incorporated other elements of the &quot;Release the Beast&quot; into the production, including percussion and power chords on an electric guitar. A talk box vocal phrase featuring the title of Daft Punk's single was also added to the recording. The Breakwater sample is credited on the single's sleeve and on the liner notes of the parent Human After All album. This was not the first time Daft Punk have sampled a song to create a new recording, as &quot;Digital Love&quot; would be a noted example.\n \n The Breakwater sample is absent from the &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; remix of &quot;Robot Rock&quot;, which consists of the song's other elements for a duration of nearly six minutes. A music video for this remix has been shot and included on the Daft Punk Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 compilation CD/DVD.\n \n The song was also used in the film Iron Man 2, in a scene where James Rhodes fights Tony Stark while both wear Iron Man (robot) suits.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Daft Punk","artistMbid":"056e4f3e-d505-4dad-8ec1-d04f521cbb56","album":"Human After All","albumMbid":"fd07d0fc-a68a-3b77-95c9-fd7ec7fea013","position":3,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":183,"location":null}
