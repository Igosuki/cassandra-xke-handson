","wikiText":"&quot;Digital Love&quot; is a song by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk. It was released as the third single from the album Discovery. As part of the album, the song is featured in the film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.\n \n As documented in the Discovery liner notes, the song features a sample of &quot;I Love You More&quot; by George Duke. The sample was worked into an electronic pop song about unspoken love with lyrics by DJ Sneak and vocals performed by Daft Punk.\n \n The track is known for the guitar solo featured prominently on its second half. Thomas Bangalter revealed that the solo was created using a mixture of elements, aided by music sequencers. &quot;No one plays solos in their songs anymore, but we wanted to include some on the album.&quot; Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo also noted the duo's use of in-studio equipment to evoke the sound of a previous artist:\n \n “ On 'Digital Love,' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge. We didn't sample Supertramp, but we had the original Wurlitzer piano they used, so we thought it would be more fun to have the original instrument and mess around with it. We use mainly vintage synthesizers, like older electric pianos like the Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Clavinet. We didn't use the Clavinet on Discovery, but I usually use it in my studio.” \n \n The band Hellogoodbye often uses the first two verses of &quot;Digital Love&quot; in place of the second verse of the song &quot;Here (In Your Arms)&quot; when performing live. A live version of the song, performed by Danish group Alphabeat is available as part of an iTunes Live EP.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Daft Punk","artistMbid":"056e4f3e-d505-4dad-8ec1-d04f521cbb56","album":"Discovery","albumMbid":"5ad66522-edce-3a77-b5fa-7956ee879239","position":3,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":239,"location":null}
