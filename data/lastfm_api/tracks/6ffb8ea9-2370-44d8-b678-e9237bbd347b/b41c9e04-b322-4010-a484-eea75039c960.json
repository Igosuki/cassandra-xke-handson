And my little brother had went to a Beach House concert the night before. And he walked in with a Beach House shirt on and I said, 'I got it. Let's call the song 'Beach Side!'&quot; and everyone's like 'yeah!. It's perfect.' And then after having said that, it's almost as if the sound of the song in all of our heads started to sound beach-y.&quot;\n Matthew Followill explained to The Music Fix how they developed this song's 'beach-y' sound: &quot;Nathan had a very '70s drum tone that we were all really excited about that. Had the lap steel, but hadn't really written a part for that yet, but I knew I wanted to use it. So, me and Jared got into the guitar room and wrote a part. And it ended up sounding beach-y and '70s.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Kings of Leon","artistMbid":"6ffb8ea9-2370-44d8-b678-e9237bbd347b","album":"Come Around Sundown","albumMbid":"06c296b7-a695-3409-9219-03458d6902f9","position":8,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":170,"location":null}
