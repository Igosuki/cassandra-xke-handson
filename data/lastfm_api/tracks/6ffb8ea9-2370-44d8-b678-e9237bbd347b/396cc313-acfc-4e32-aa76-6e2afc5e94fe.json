In the video, however, it's performed by a group in a country-western style rather than the band's original Latin/calypso-infused coda style, possibly to reflect the band's southern roots. The Kings of Leon have rarely performed this final part of the song live. (live video from houston in 2006.

When the band toured with Pearl Jam, as well as during Lollapalooza 2007, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder would come out playing tambourines and sing the song alongside Caleb Followill, trading lines with the Kings of Leon lead singer.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Kings of Leon","artistMbid":"6ffb8ea9-2370-44d8-b678-e9237bbd347b","album":"Aha Shake Heartbreak","albumMbid":"5871b60a-6a16-333f-8f0d-0dbda8b24a05","position":1,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":234,"location":null}
