The pyrotechnics appearing on the video are computer generated and were added later on.\n The single release is notable for its B-sides, which include the album versions of &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot;, two songs which also include guest appearances by rock guitarists (Steve Stevens and Eddie Van Halen, respectively). The remix of the song which was just recently made features J-Bo of the rap group YoungBloodz..\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Michael Jackson","artistMbid":"210769a3-4aca-4199-a2e1-676ef376e078","album":"Dangerous","albumMbid":"0db0cb96-19e5-3ecb-8bcb-9548b6cd1150","position":10,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":328,"location":null}
