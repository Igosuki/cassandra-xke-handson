","wikiText":"<strong>Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'</strong> is a 1983 single released from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Michael Jackson</a>'s multi-platinum selling 1982 album <a title=\"Michael Jackson - Thriller\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Thriller</a>.

As usual with Jackson, who used the latest in studio technology, the opening snare hits of the song came courtesy of the Fairlight CMI, a $30,000 Australian sampler and synthesizer.\n \n &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; continued the trend of hit singles for Jackson, eventually peaking at number five on the Pop and on the R&amp;B charts, and gaining time on radio playlists across the country. The song was often not played at full length, however, due to industry format standards.\n \n One of the songs released as a single without an accompanying video, &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; nonetheless has attained a popularity rivaling its sister compositions on the album, and has become Jackson's song of choice for opening live concerts. Not being as strictly associated with a specific dance routine as those others has arguably allowed for more flexibility in performances and staging.\n \n Two notable occurrences during live performances are the physically complicated &quot;stop/start&quot; dance technique that brings Jackson and his dancers to a frozen stop several times, and the sing-along between performer and audience during the bridge.\n \n &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; was also used on every set list of Jackson's tours, from the Victory Tour in 1984, right the way through to the HIStory Tour in 1997. Unlike most of the other songs performed live, &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; has never been lip-synched during any of Jackson's tours.\n \n The song was re-recorded by Jackson and R&amp;B artist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Akon\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Akon</a> for the 2008 album <a title=\"Michael Jackson - Thriller 25\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller+25\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Thriller 25</a>.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Michael Jackson","artistMbid":"210769a3-4aca-4199-a2e1-676ef376e078","album":"Thriller","albumMbid":"196971df-a7b6-3cdb-8e59-f43967cd29bf","position":1,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":254,"location":null}
