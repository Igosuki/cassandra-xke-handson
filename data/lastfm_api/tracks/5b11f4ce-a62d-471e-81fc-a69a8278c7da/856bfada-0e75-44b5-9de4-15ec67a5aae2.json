","wikiText":"&quot;Love Buzz&quot; is a song written by Robbie van Leeuwen of Dutch rock band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Shocking+Blue\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Shocking Blue</a>. The American grunge band Nirvana recorded a cover version of the song for its debut single, released on Sub Pop in 1988.

A relentless two-chord garage beat which lays down some serious foundations for a sheer monster of a guitar to howl over. The volume control ain't been built yet which can do justice to this three-piece!&quot; True also made &quot;Love Buzz&quot; joint-US Single of the Week.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Nirvana","artistMbid":"5b11f4ce-a62d-471e-81fc-a69a8278c7da","album":"With the Lights Out","albumMbid":"bc38ef5f-de82-4fe7-9646-72feb62e0cca","position":1,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":223,"location":null}
