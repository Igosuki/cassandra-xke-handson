The 7&quot; vinyl includes &quot;I'll Try Anything Once&quot;, performed by Julian Casablancas on the keyboard. The music video for &quot;Heart in a Cage&quot; was directed by Samuel Bayer, and was shot in New York City. It was shot in black and white and featured the band members playing in various locations in the city, such as on tall skyscrapers, or, in singer Julian Casablancas's case, the pavement. As said in Rolling Stone, Albert Hammond, Jr. almost died on the set of the shooting of the video when 40 mph winds almost blew him off the top of the building. Hammond commented that &quot;It's not like it's the first time I've almost died on a shooting for a music video.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"The Strokes","artistMbid":"f181961b-20f7-459e-89de-920ef03c7ed0","album":"First Impressions of Earth","albumMbid":"04d947c3-83c8-3d12-96cd-802c64aea532","position":3,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":206,"location":null}
