The single peaked at 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at 18 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the only song the band performed at Live 8.\n \n The song was featured in the closing credits of the 2005 film The Matador, as well as the 2007 movie Southland Tales as a crucial part of the storyline in which Pilot Abilene (played by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Timberlake\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Justin Timberlake</a>) lip-synchs it. It was also mentioned in the graphic novel preceding the film, Southland Tales: The Prequel Saga. It also played over the opening of the pilot of the television series Jericho. It is heard at the end of the 2008 Ben Stein film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. The song plays in virtually its entirety over the first segment of the first episode of the 2008 PBS documentary series &quot;Carrier.&quot; Nike used the song in a commercial for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Following this Nike ad, the song rose as high as #38 on iTunes.\n \n Like &quot;<a title=\"The Killers &ndash; Mr. Brightside\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Mr.+Brightside\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Mr. Brightside</a>&quot;, the song features two videos. The earlier version features The Killers singing while walking down Brick Lane in London accompanied by a crowd. The video also featured shots of the audience who attended The Killers concert at the London Astoria on July 8, 2004. The later version, directed by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn, features a surreal, dream-like sequence where the Killers, dressed as cowboys, are attacked by scantily-clad female warriors armed with boomerangs. The story in the video is told out of order, but can be put in its order by the numbers displayed in the video.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"The Killers","artistMbid":"24b4aee8-32ed-4163-98f7-55bae67411ae","album":"Hot Fuss","albumMbid":"81553d43-3f83-36b2-a017-1394b6b4b675","position":5,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":302,"location":null}
