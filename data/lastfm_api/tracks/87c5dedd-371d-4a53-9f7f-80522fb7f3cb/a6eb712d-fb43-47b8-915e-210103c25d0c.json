It's not erotic or sensual even if it may sound like that. As you know, you create pretty deep, full-on love relationships with friends.      A lot of it is also about myself. I can be a coward a lot of the time and there comes a moment when I write a song when I get quite brave. It's a lot about me dealing with myself rather than attacking other people. Would I like to know the future? No.  ","wikiText":"&quot;A lot of my songs - including 'Big Time Sensuality' - are about my friends, not my lovers.
