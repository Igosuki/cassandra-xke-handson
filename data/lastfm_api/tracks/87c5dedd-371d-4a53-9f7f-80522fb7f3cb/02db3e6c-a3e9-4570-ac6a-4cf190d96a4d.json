I'd been collecting them and stuff. The main thing was that I wanted to write my own songs in music boxes.\n \n     In the beginning, the music box company weren't very excited. They'd made wooden boxes for eons and I wanted see-through plexiglass. They couldn't get their head round it - they were like 'Why?'\n \n     They wanted to make the plonky sound softer with wood but I wanted it as hard as possible, like it was frozen. In the end, they said it was the best thing they'd ever done.&quot;\n \n &quot;It's about wanting to communicate, for sure. It's less cocoon-ish than the rest of the songs [on Vespertine]. It's definitely wanting to tell someone something.&quot;\n \n &quot;We discussed how to do something with the moving image that was a mirror of what was happening musically. . . . It had to have a different look from the video footage and from the digitally altered video footage. I knew it had to look as luscious as possible,” Chaudoir says. “It’s stripping away the artifice and the digital effects, into the raw image of Björk.”\n \n Pagan Poetry is written and produced by Björk. It is the second song to be taken off her fourth studio album &quot;Vespertine&quot; as a single. The video to the track is done by Nick Knight who previously photographed Björk for the Homogenic cover image. Production: Gainsbury &amp; Whiting.
