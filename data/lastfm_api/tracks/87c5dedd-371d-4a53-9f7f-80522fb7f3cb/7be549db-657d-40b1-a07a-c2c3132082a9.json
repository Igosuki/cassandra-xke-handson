I ended up doing two records and touring the world. I'd never been so long away from Iceland, so when I started preparing for Homogenic, it was very obviously supposed to be a love album to Iceland nature. I'd learned enough about studios and beats to make modern Icelandic pop music. It's isn't Icelandic music trying to be English or American. I was doing a lot of experimenting with beats trying to make them sound volcanic. With this song, I really had a sort of National Anthem in mind. Not the National Anthem but certain classic Icelandic songs - very romantic, very proud.&quot;\n \n Jóga was composed by Björk. It was produced by her and Mark Bell at the El Cortijo studios in Spain. The lyrics for it were written by Björk's long-term collaborator Sjón. Jóga became the first single from her third studio album 'Homogenic'. The video was shot on location in Iceland by the French videodirector Michel Gondry, using a 16mm handheld camera, and it was subsequently digitally processed into luscious computer-animated landscapes, alive and moving in synchronization with the beats of the song.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Björk","artistMbid":"87c5dedd-371d-4a53-9f7f-80522fb7f3cb","album":"Family Tree (Cd6 Greatest Hits)","albumMbid":"","position":5,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":420,"location":null}
