The hook reveals his reason for staying in the relationship, which was because of the sex. &quot;Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?/ I won't lie, that I can't deny/ I did it all for the nookie&quot;.\n \n In a 2008 interview with British <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a> magazine Kerrang, guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wes+Borland\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wes Borland</a> had the following to say about how the lyrical content turned out: &quot;The music was cool, but I didn't like the lyrics at all. The funny thing is that <a title=\"Limp Bizkit &ndash; Nookie\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit/_/Nookie\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Nookie</a> was actually the working title. When we were in the studio there was a porn magazine that had the word 'nookie' on the cover, so I was like, 'This song's called <a title=\"Limp Bizkit &ndash; Nookie\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit/_/Nookie\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Nookie</a>!', I never thought someone would actually run with it. I suppose it's all my fault.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Limp Bizkit","artistMbid":"8f9d6bb2-dba4-4cca-9967-cc02b9f4820c","album":"Significant Other","albumMbid":"be3e00aa-368a-3f09-ac96-cd094e9a7151","position":3,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":266,"location":null}
