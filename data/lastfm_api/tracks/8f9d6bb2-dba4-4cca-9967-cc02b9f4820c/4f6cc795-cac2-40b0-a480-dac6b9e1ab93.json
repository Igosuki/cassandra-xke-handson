It was the fifth and final single released from the album.\n \n There were three versions of this single released, but only two were widely available. The album version of the song was used as the official theme song for the WWF Pay-Per-View event, WrestleMania X-Seven.\n \n Musically, the song is somewhat of a step away from what was the norm for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Limp Bizkit</a> during this time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fred+Durst\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Fred Durst</a> makes greater usage of singing than rapping on the track, the rhythmic timing of the verse is somewhat more complex than they would normally play in, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wes+Borland\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wes Borland</a> played mainly complex melodic lines and fully voiced guitar chords instead of the root/fifth powerchords used in most <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/metal\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">metal</a>. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Lethal\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">DJ Lethal</a> plays and scratches a sample of &quot;Check out my melody&quot; from the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+B.+&amp;+Rakim\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Eric B. &amp; Rakim</a> song &quot;<a title=\"Eric B. &amp; Rakim &ndash; My Melody\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+B.+&amp;+Rakim/_/My+Melody\" class=\"bbcode_track\">My Melody</a>&quot; from their groundbreaking 1987 album <a title=\"Eric B. &amp; Rakim - Paid In Full\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+B.+&amp;+Rakim/Paid+In+Full\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Paid In Full</a>.\n \n The music video for &quot;<a title=\"Limp Bizkit &ndash; My Way\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit/_/My+Way\" class=\"bbcode_track\">My Way</a>&quot; is a departure from the perceived serious tone of the song itself, which according to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fred+Durst\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Fred Durst</a> was done because &quot;bands tend to take themselves way too seriously&quot;. Also, as the video doesn't follow any specific theme, and was basically done however the band wanted without restriction, it does follow the theme of the song in that sense.\n \n At the beginning of the video, Durst and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wes+Borland\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wes Borland</a> are conversing on what should be done for the video, as the two have no ideas, and Durst suggest they check 'wardrobe' for ideas. The video then follows the groups various antics as they attempt to film the video in a variety of settings, including:\n \n     * A big band where <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fred+Durst\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Fred Durst</a> conducts the rest of the band to play.\n     * A line of motorcycles on which the band ride.\n     * A jungle with the band dressed up as cavemen.\n \n The video also shows scenes of the band members trying on various costumes, notably a two-piece horse costume, among others.\n \n At the end of the motorcycle scene, the band gets up and leaves, looking angry. At the end of orchestra scene, the band just walks away. The last scene in the video shows the end of the caveman scene, where Durst takes a big boulder and throws it at Borland.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Limp Bizkit","artistMbid":"8f9d6bb2-dba4-4cca-9967-cc02b9f4820c","album":"My Way","albumMbid":"52dd5837-eade-4140-9f3e-624fd4a64323","position":1,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":273,"location":null}
