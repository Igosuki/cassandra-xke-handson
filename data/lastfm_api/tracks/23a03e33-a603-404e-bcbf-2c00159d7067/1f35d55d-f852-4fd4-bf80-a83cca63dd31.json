An alternate version was made showing actors looking back on photographs and memories, reflecting the song's subject matter, though this was very rarely shown. It was the second and final video to feature Atom Willard playing the drums.\n \n The original music video starts with Kriesel playing the opening melody with his special, &quot;k-covered&quot; bass, hence to his nickname of Greg K, then Willard comes in, and finally Holland and Noodles. The melody stays about the same throughout the song.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"The Offspring","artistMbid":"23a03e33-a603-404e-bcbf-2c00159d7067","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"01b9a12a-0432-41bb-8c89-057357673cb5","position":1,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":205,"location":null}
