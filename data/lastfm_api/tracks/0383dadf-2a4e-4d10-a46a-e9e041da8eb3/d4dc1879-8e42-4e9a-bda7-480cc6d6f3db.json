In live performances, the lead vocals during the chorus were sung by Freddie Mercury and harmonised with an upper voice (Roger Taylor) and a lower voice (Brian May). In the studio version, there is no higher harmony. The lead vocals are sung by Freddie Mercury, while Brian May sings lead on the intro and choruses.\n \n The single version (which can be found on Greatest Hits) omits the extended guitar interludes between the verses as well as fading out before the ending.\n \n &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; was released as a Double A-side with the song &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; Bicycle Race\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Bicycle+Race\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Bicycle Race</a>.&quot; This cut includes the line &quot;Get on your bikes and ride&quot;. Bicycle Race also contains the line &quot;Fat bottomed girls, they'll be riding today, so look out for those beauties, oh yeah&quot;, completing a double cross-reference between the two songs.\n \n The original single cover featured a nude woman riding a bicycle. When many stores refused to stock the single because of the cover, the label altered the image so that the woman was wearing panties.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Queen","artistMbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"67359849-625a-4017-baa8-d8cf74cb0daf","position":6,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":204,"location":null}
