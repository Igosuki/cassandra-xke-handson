Several recordings were laid over each other to achieve the final sound.\n \n The lyrics have cosmic imagery describing feelings of power and exhilaration, for example &quot;I'm gonna go, go, go there's no stopping me / I'm burning through the sky yeah 200 degreesâ€¦&quot;.\n \n The single reached #9 in the UK charts but only #86 in the US. \n \n Despite the fact that the studio version is one of Queen's most popular songs, it only lasted from 1978-1979 live, with the last performance in the Crazy Tour.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Queen","artistMbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"67359849-625a-4017-baa8-d8cf74cb0daf","position":15,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":211,"location":null}
