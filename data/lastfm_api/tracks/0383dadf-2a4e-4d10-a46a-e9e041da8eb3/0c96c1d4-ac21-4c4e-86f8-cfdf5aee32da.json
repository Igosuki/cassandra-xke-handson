The song was played live from 1979-1984.\n \n Brian May wrote &quot;Save Me&quot; about a friend whose relationship had ended, and played piano, synths and guitars (electric and twelve-string acoustic) on it.\n \n Played live, the song would typically feature a short piano introduction absent from the studio version. This introduction can be found in a Brian May solo composition &quot;My Boy&quot; which can only be found much later on the 1998 compilation album &quot;Lullabies With A Difference&quot;. The general melody could have been conceived by May as early as 1980 as the intro to the live version of &quot;Save Me&quot; exhibits.\n \n In addition, the lyrics &quot;I'm naked and I'm far from home&quot; were uttered near the end of the pilot episode of the television series &quot;Highlander&quot; (whose theme was another Queen song, &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;) by Christopher Lambert's character.\n \n In 2009, May assisted in the recording of a newl version to be featured on the website of his <a href=\"http://www.save-me.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Save Me</a> campaign, with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kerry+Ellis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kerry Ellis</a> on lead vocals. \n \n The website states:\n &quot;Use your vote to ensure that the present laws protecting animals from cruelty are kept in place, more carefully monitored, legally tightened up, and fully enforced.&quot;\n \n     * Brian May: lead, rhythm and acoustic twelve-string guitars, piano, synthesizer, backing vocals.\n     * Roger Taylor: Drums, backing vocals.\n     * Freddie Mercury: Lead and backing vocals.\n     * John Deacon: bass.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Queen","artistMbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"67359849-625a-4017-baa8-d8cf74cb0daf","position":14,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":228,"location":null}
