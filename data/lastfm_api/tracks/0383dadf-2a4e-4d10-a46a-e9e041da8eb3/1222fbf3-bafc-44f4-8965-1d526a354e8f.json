Mercury also sang the lead in live performances.\n \n An instrumental version of the song, titled <a title=\"Queen &ndash; Forever\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Forever\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Forever</a>, was included as a bonus track on the CD version of the album.

The song was written – I've documented this very well, I know – but what happened was we went to see the Highlander rushes with Russell Mulcahy, and that was our first experience in any way with Highlander – I hadn't read the script; I don't think any of us had – and it was very moving. [The film is] about a man who becomes conscious that he's immortal, and he's reluctant to accept that fact, but he's told that if he falls in love he's in big trouble, but of course he falls in love anyway. And the girl that he falls in love with eventually grows old and dies in his arms, and that kind of opened up a floodgate in me – I was dealing with a lot of tragedies in my life: the death of my father, the death of my marriage, and so forth. I could immediately hear this 'Who Wants To Live Forever' in my head, and it was almost complete in the car going home – I remember singing it to my manager as he drove me home, and he was pretty surprised. He said, 'Where did that come from?' and I said, 'I don't even know.'&quot;\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Queen","artistMbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","album":"Greatest Hits II","albumMbid":"e66653dc-e884-37cf-9fb5-88136138e121","position":9,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":316,"location":null}
