The song is also noted for its hard riff and vocal harmonies. The song remained a live favourite, performed at virtually every concert from late 1974 through 1986, often played in segments, with the ending played as a reprise.\n \n It was also featured on the 1997 compilation album <a title=\"Queen - Queen Rocks\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Queen+Rocks\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Queen Rocks</a>. In the accompanying music video, the band is seen playing at the Rainbow Theatre.\n \n     * The lyric &quot;Down in the city just Hoople and me&quot; is a reference to when Queen was touring with the band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mott+the+Hoople\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mott the Hoople</a> earlier in their career.\n \n     * Near the end, the lyrics &quot;Go, go, go, little queenie&quot; can be heard, a reference to the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chuck+Berry\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Chuck Berry</a>'s 1959 B-side &quot;<a title=\"Chuck Berry &ndash; Little Queenie\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chuck+Berry/_/Little+Queenie\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Little Queenie</a>.&quot;\n \n     * There is very rare and subtle use of organ on the 'climb' coming out of the guitar solo, beneath the lyrics &quot;Whatever comes of you and me...&quot;.\n \n     * In concert, a double was used with lighting cues to create the illusion that Mercury was disappearing from one side of the stage and reappearing on another.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Queen","artistMbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"67359849-625a-4017-baa8-d8cf74cb0daf","position":10,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":253,"location":null}
