The land of Rhye was originally made up by Mercury and his sister Kashmira when they were children. After joining Queen as an adult, Mercury wrote some songs about that country, including &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;, <a title=\"Queen &ndash; Lily of the Valley\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Lily+of+the+Valley\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Lily of the Valley</a>, &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; My Fairy King\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/My+Fairy+King\" class=\"bbcode_track\">My Fairy King</a>, &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; Ogre Battle\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Ogre+Battle\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Ogre Battle</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/The+Fairy+Feller%27s+Master-Stroke\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke</a>&quot;,&quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; The March of the Black Queen\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/The+March+of+the+Black+Queen\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The March of the Black Queen</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; Great King Rat\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Great+King+Rat\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Great King Rat</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; Mad The Swine\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Mad+The+Swine\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Mad The Swine</a>&quot;.\n \n The song became a live favourite throughout Queen's existence. It features a distinctive arpeggiated piano introduction. The theme also appears at the end of &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; It's a Beautiful Day\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/It%27s+a+Beautiful+Day\" class=\"bbcode_track\">It's a Beautiful Day</a>&quot;.\n \n The version on <a title=\"Queen - Queen II\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Queen+II\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Queen II</a> ends with a cross fade, instruments blending into several people singing &quot;I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside&quot;. Its inclusion here on the final track of Queen II is briefly mirrored in the first few seconds of &quot;<a title=\"Queen &ndash; Brighton Rock\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Brighton+Rock\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Brighton Rock</a>&quot;, which opens their next album, <a title=\"Queen - Sheer Heart Attack\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Sheer+Heart+Attack\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Sheer Heart Attack</a>. (A few whistled bars can be heard over the introductory noise).\n \n In a 1977 radio interview, Freddie Mercury described the subject of the song as a &quot;figment of his imagination.&quot; In the Queen musical We Will Rock You, the Seven Seas of Rhye is a place where the Bohemians are taken after they are brainstormed by Khashoggi.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Queen","artistMbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"67359849-625a-4017-baa8-d8cf74cb0daf","position":12,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":76,"location":null}
