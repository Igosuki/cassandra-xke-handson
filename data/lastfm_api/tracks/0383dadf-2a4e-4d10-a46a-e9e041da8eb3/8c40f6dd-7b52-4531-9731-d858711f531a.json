He played piano and did all of the vocals. The lead vocal was sung in studio, produced through headphones elsewhere in the studio in a tin bucket. A microphone picked up the sound from the bucket, which gives it a hollow &quot;megaphone&quot; sound. The guitar solo is also reported to have been recorded on the vocal track, as there were no more tracks to record on.","wikiText":"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon was another song by Mercury.
