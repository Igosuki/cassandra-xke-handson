When recording the track May played a rough version on piano for Roy Thomas Baker. He called his own skills on the piano sub-par at the time. \n \n May performed the song live on the roof of Buckingham Palace for the Queen's golden jubilee in 2002 and  has stated that he performed the song on the roof of Buckingham Palace as an homage to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jimi Hendrix</a>'s version of &quot;<a title=\"Jimi Hendrix &ndash; The Star-Spangled Banner\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix/_/The+Star-Spangled+Banner\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>&quot;.\n \n Guitar layering is one of May's distinctive techniques as a rock guitarist. He has stated that the technique was born in his mind looking for a violin sound. For tracks like this, he stated he can use &quot;up to 30&quot; layers, using a small amplifier named the 'Deacy Amp' built by John Deacon, and later released commercially like the &quot;Brian May&quot; amplifier by Vox.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Queen","artistMbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","album":"A Night at the Opera / The Works","albumMbid":"6b77ffec-8bc7-4f9a-b302-d34704bf2af1","position":12,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":75,"location":null}
