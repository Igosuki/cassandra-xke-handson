During this version, Jim Morrison talks for a short while to a female audience member about his Zodiac sign and, with a sudden, ironic twist that causes the audience to erupt in laughter, denounces his beliefs in it. The song was also featured twice in the movie The Doors; the studio version in the film, and the aforementioned live version over the end credits.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"The Doors","artistMbid":"9efff43b-3b29-4082-824e-bc82f646f93d","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"5c740868-c481-301d-8871-b3da741fe9ad","position":13,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":259,"location":null}
