No effects are used throughout the track, except for some reverb on the piano.\n \n The song's subject matter, according to the unofficial transcript of the lyrics, by fans[1], is Jónsi's relationship with his English-speaking boyfriend, the lyrics being written in English as a form of communication with him on a very personal level. In the first part of the lyrics, the singer is apparently admitting having betrayed his partner with someone else and he is begging him to be forgiven [&quot;I want him to know/what I have done&quot;]; in the second (falsetto) part, he expresses his desire to be in harmony with his partner once again, using references to birds, and to birdsong as a metaphor for love.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Sigur Rós","artistMbid":"f6f2326f-6b25-4170-b89d-e235b25508e8","album":"Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust","albumMbid":"","position":11,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":376,"location":null}
