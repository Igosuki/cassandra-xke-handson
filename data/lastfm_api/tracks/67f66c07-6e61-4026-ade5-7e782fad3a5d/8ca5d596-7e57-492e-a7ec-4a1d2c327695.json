It is performed solo by vocalist/guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Dave Grohl</a>.\n \n &quot;Best of You&quot; gave Foo Fighters their highest ever entry on the Australian rock radio station Triple J's Hottest 100 at #4.\n \n Its music video was directed by Mark Pellington, best known for his work on the video for &quot;<a title=\"Pearl Jam &ndash; Jeremy\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/_/Jeremy\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Jeremy</a>&quot; by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Pearl Jam</a>. He was inspired by the death of his wife a few months prior to the shoot, and was drawn to the song's notion of dealing with pain in life.\n \n The video features the band playing on top of a tower. Along with the band's scenes are some random clips that show pain, depression, or anger:\n     * Clips with children playing alone or with each other, one scene shows one girl hugging another.\n     * A car crash\n     * A lion pouncing on its prey, which is a vulture\n     * A snake attacks a rodent\n     * A zebra kicks another zebra behind itself\n     * A snarling wolf\n     * Crash test dummies being crushed by a car crash test\n     * Men and women showing affection for each other.\n \n There have been many remakes of the video on MySpace, with some featuring live performances, CGI/animation, and parodies of the original video's plot line. This song was featured on the MTV series Making the Video.\n \n The band performed the song at Live Earth in London, where Grohl dedicated the song to &quot;you know who.&quot; This is widely believed to be aimed at the George W. Bush administration and their environmental policy. After the band's performance at Live Earth, the song again entered the UK charts at #38. It had previously peaked at #4, giving them their highest performing song there as well. \n \n <strong>COVERS:</strong>\n *<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Prince</a> covered the song during the halftime show at Super Bowl XLI in Miami, Florida, on February 4, 2007. Drummer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Hawkins\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Taylor Hawkins</a> expressed surprise by the performance, due to Prince's prior criticism of the band's desire to release a cover version of his song, &quot;<a title=\"Foo Fighters &ndash; Darling Nikki\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Darling+Nikki\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Darling Nikki</a>&quot;, in 2003.\n *Welsh band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stereophonics\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Stereophonics</a> covered the song for BBC Radio 1 in December 2007\n \n <strong>MEDIA</strong>\n *The song was also mentioned in an episode of the NBC series 30 Rock.\n *At the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, the song was played as the two competitors, Glasgow Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg, entered the field at the City of Manchester Stadium, England and when Anatoliy Tymoschuk lifted the trophy.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Foo Fighters","artistMbid":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","album":"In Your Honor","albumMbid":"1a74df76-3598-357c-9bbb-f2a0c1f4cdf0","position":3,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":301,"location":null}
