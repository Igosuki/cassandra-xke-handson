It was released on two main discs in 2000.  The song charted at #17 on the Modern Rock Tracks\n \n <strong>MUSIC VIDEO</strong>:\n The video, directed by Phil Harder, shows the band in a remake of the Apollo 11 moon mission and incorporates heavy use of NASA stock footage. They experience zero-gravity in the space capsule (where they conduct experiments and perform the song with instruments), land on the moon, plant a Foo Fighters flag, and return to Earth where they are welcomed back as heroes during a ticker-tape parade. Many moments and images of the Apollo era are re-enacted, such as the band meeting President Richard Nixon, bassist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Mendel\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Nate Mendel</a> golfing on the moon (a nod to Alan Shepard during Apollo 14), and depictions of Vietnam war protests. The video ends with a portrait of the band in the style of a traditional astronaut crew photo.\n \n <strong>MEDIA</strong>:\n The opening of &quot;Next Year&quot; was used as the theme song for the NBC television series Ed (2000-2004).\n \n The show's creators, Rob Burnett and Jon Beckerman (formerly of the Late Show with David Letterman) used the song despite knowledge of production company Viacom's insistence that they own the rights to the show's theme song. &quot;Next Year&quot; was thus ultimately replaced by Clem Snide's &quot;Moment in the Sun&quot; during the second season. As a result of outcries from Burnett and Beckerman, however, Viacom relented and &quot;Next Year&quot; returned as the theme song in the third and fourth seasons.\n \n The show was also a production of Letterman's Worldwide Pants Incorporated with Letterman serving as an executive producer. Burnett, Beckerman, and Letterman in particular are all known to be avid Foo Fighters fans. In one episode of the show, a character is seen hanging a poster of the band in her office.\n \n The band performed the song on the Late Show in October of 2000, with regular guitarist Dave Grohl on drums/vocals and regular drummer Taylor Hawkins on mellotron. The two switch instruments for the end of the song.\n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Foo Fighters","artistMbid":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","album":"There Is Nothing Left to Lose","albumMbid":"12b54c44-8e71-4cda-9bb2-937fe3faa85d","position":8,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":276,"location":null}
