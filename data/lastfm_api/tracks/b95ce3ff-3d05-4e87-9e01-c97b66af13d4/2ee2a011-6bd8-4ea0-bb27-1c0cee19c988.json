It also refers to Eminem's role in the music industry and his cultural effects.\n \n The song mocks a number of Eminem's critics, including Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne Cheney, the FCC and MTV, Chris Kirkpatrick, as well as lampooning comparisons of Eminem to Elvis Presley as a Caucasian succeeding commercially in a predominantly African-American art form. A line in the song also attacks his own mother Debbie Mathers for the lawsuit she filed against him for the lyrics of his debut single &quot;My Name Is&quot;.\n \n The opening lyric &quot;Two trailer park girls go round the outside&quot; is based on the single &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; by Malcolm McLaren, while the introduction which is spoken by Obie Trice &quot;Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks.&quot; is sampled from his own track &quot;Rap Name&quot;. The round the outside lyric could be considered a subliminal diss to Canibus, who used a similar line in Box Cutta Blade Runna, released on &quot;C! True Hollywood Stories&quot; which makes numerous disses against Eminem.\n \n A sample from the track, the phrase &quot;nobody listens to techno&quot;, became an underground techno bootleg anthem produced by Deep Dish and Danny Howells under the alias Size DDD (Deep Dish Danny). The song was played by many well-known DJs to satirize the claim. The song was also parodied on All That, a skit show on Nickelodeon, as &quot;Without Meat&quot;. It was also parodied on MADtv, a skit show on FOX, as &quot;Whats on TV?&quot;. In the second verse a line samples the intro from &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;.\n \n The background saxophone riff was sampled for Drunkenmunky's 2002 club hit &quot;E&quot; (helpÂ·info).\n \n Some of the lyrics are altered on the clean version, such as &quot;This is about to get heavy&quot; also &quot;Jiggle your hips&quot; is placed to get rid of a sexually explicit remark in the 1st verse.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Eminem","artistMbid":"b95ce3ff-3d05-4e87-9e01-c97b66af13d4","album":"Greatest Hits","albumMbid":"42291960-92e2-4753-abd5-1f91cfdc7c5b","position":11,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":290,"location":null}
