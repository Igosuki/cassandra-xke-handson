This word is believed to be &quot;Suge&quot;, a reference to Suge Knight with whom Dr. Dre had problems in the mid 90's.\n &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; was included on Eminem's compilation album Curtain Call: The Hits in 2005.\n In addition, this song also brings up some issues with his ongoing feud with Ja Rule who made some remarks about Hailie, Marshall's daughter, on a song called &quot;Loose Change&quot;. Ja Rule called Eminem's wife 'a known slut' and his mother a crackhead in the song and wondered what Eminem's 12 year old daughter Hailie was going to be &quot;when she grows up&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Eminem","artistMbid":"b95ce3ff-3d05-4e87-9e01-c97b66af13d4","album":"Curtain Call: The Hits","albumMbid":"489b6168-d995-3394-9e7c-78b9d034abba","position":10,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":291,"location":null}
