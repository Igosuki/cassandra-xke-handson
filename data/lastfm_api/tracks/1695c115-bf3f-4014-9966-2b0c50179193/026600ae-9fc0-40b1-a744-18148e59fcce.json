As the title suggests, it concerns the thoughts of a dying atheist, scared by his non-belief in an afterlife. Now, at the moment of his death, he must face the disheartening non-existence he will soon inhabit.   Just before the bridge, at 2:04, Wolstenholme can be heard jumping into the pool at Grouse Lodge recording studio as Howard hits his cymbals.
