It was also the band's first Top 10 hit in the UK, peaking at number eight, besting the number eleven peak of &quot;Plug In Baby&quot;.\n \n This song is notable for Chris Wolstenholme's groovy synth-bass riff that was inspired by Michael Jackson.\n \n The video depicts a number of military officials seated at a round table performing actions simultaneously, moving to the beat of the song, as Muse play the song on the table, with the officials apparently oblivious to Muse's presence. Eventually, the officers begin to start dancing on the table, seeming to go insane. They eventually end up crawling. It is partially based on Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\n \n Time Is Running Out was featured on the FLYING-DOG Soundtrack \n The song has been featured in an episode of Entourage entitled &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; and in 2008, the song was featured on Torchwood Declassified, to represent the deaths of two main characters. \n In 2006, the song was featured in the trailer for the film Running Scared and was also used in promotional spots of the Turner Classic Movies channel. \n In 2005, The Feeling covered the song for Jo Whiley's Live Lounge on Radio One.
