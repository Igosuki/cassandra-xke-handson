The single was released in September 2001 and earned the band its first Grammy nomination. The song's working title was &quot;Suicide&quot;; the band members claim the change was not caused by pressure from their record company. The words &quot;We're rolling Suicide&quot; can still be heard faintly in the album versions's opening seconds - though this intro is only on certain pressings of the album. The song is included as a playable track in the music video games Rock Band 2 and Rock Band Unplugged.","wikiText":"Chop Suey! is the first single from American heavy metal band System of a Down's second album Toxicity.
