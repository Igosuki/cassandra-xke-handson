The song had a fairly low profile for some time before attracting further attention in 2006, after Placebo began to include it in their set whilst touring to promote Meds.\n \n &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was released as a single in October, 2006, and was included on the re-released version of Meds in 2007, along with the song, 'UNEEDMEMORETHANINEEDU'. It was then included on Covers, a rerelease of the Sleeping With Ghosts bonus disc.  It gained popularity once again in early 2010 as it was used in a video hyping a career ending match for wrestler Shawn Michaels as he took on The Undertaker at WWE's Wrestlemania XXVI.\n \n Placebo's take on the song is more downbeat than the original, and focuses more on instrumentation. It has been described by Q Magazine as 'sound[ing] more like a pact with the Devil' than the original 'deal with God'.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Placebo","artistMbid":"81b9963b-7ff7-47f7-9afb-fe454d8db43c","album":"Sleeping With Ghosts (bonus disc)","albumMbid":"","position":1,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":293,"location":null}
