Released in March 2003, it was lifted from their album Sleeping with Ghosts.\n \n Critics generally praised the single upon its release. Reviewing Sleeping with Ghosts, BBC.co.uk's rock/indie reviewer Dan Tallis described &quot;The Bitter End&quot; as &quot;a good pop tune&quot;, having &quot;just the right amount of dark, gothic atmosphere to please their fans and enough radio friendly guitars to please the new generation of indie kids.&quot; The Times thought the song &quot;ramped up the energy level to devastating effect.&quot;\n \n Rock Sound reasoned that the track's &quot;kick ass romp&quot; reinforces &quot;their status as purveyors of pure indie pop in the vein of The Smiths.&quot; However, NME saw differing influences woven in the track, reporting that &quot;The Bitter End&quot; &quot;sees Placebo powering along with a relentless U2- chasing-after-The Cure melody that's as infectious as 24.&quot;\n \n Summarising Placebo's 2004 singles collection, Once More with Feeling, BBC.co.uk's Nottingham music reviewer Jaime Gill stated that &quot;each song stems from a songwriter so instinctive and precise that when he writes a song called &quot;The Bitter End&quot;, that's exactly what it sounds like.&quot;\n \n It was featured in the soundtracks of &quot;Radio Big&quot; in the Playstation 2 game SSX3.\n \n The music video sees the band playing in the dish of the Lovell Telescope, one of the largest radio telescopes. Halfway through the video, it displays an infra-red image of a couple chasing after each other. They eventually catch each other up and kiss against a wall. Near the end of the video, the band is rained upon. It was filmed in close to Stockport in Cheshire, England.\n \n \n \n The Bitter End is also featured on the French Version of guitar hero: world tour.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.","similarityMatch":0.0,"artist":"Placebo","artistMbid":"81b9963b-7ff7-47f7-9afb-fe454d8db43c","album":"Sleeping With Ghosts","albumMbid":"1301e2cd-7398-3206-9ae2-b6ac47ec348c","position":5,"fullTrackAvailable":false,"nowPlaying":false,"playedWhen":null,"duration":190,"location":null}
