Some of their countless contributions to the arts include the Grammy® award winning 3D album packaging for 10,000 Days, music videos that stand alone as pieces of cinematic brilliance and live shows that include elaborate lighting installations, spectacular laser displays and video displays as brilliant as the performances themselves.<br /><br />The last time that Tool toured Australian shores, audiences were left entranced and enthralled by the awesome power and impact of a performance from the faultless quartet:<br /><br />‘Just before they reach the song’s emotional height they take a left-turn into the extended instrumental version. It makes for one final surprise before Tool clock off for the night, no doubt having blown thousands of tiny minds in the process. I know the feeling.’ – The Vine<br /><br />‘It’s these moments that separate Tool from the chasing pack, something quite intensely breathtaking to draw the crowd out of melody induced catatonia, this ability that suddenly makes hypnotic punters stand up and pay attention.’ - FasterLouder<br /><br />Don’t miss the multi-sensory experience that is a performance by groundbreaking musicians Tool. With anticipation high and the promise of one of the first tastes of their much-awaited upcoming album, tickets will not last long!</div>","url":"http://www.last.fm/event/3505846+Tool+at+Allphones+Arena+on+3+May+2013","website":"http://www.frontiertouring.com/tool","attendance":30,"reviews":0,"venue":{"name":"Allphones Arena","url":"http://www.last.fm/venue/9222554+Allphones+Arena","website":"http://allphonesarena.com.au/","city":"Sydney Olympic Park","country":"Australia","street":"Olympic Blvd","postal":"2127","phonenumber":"(02) 8765 4321","latitude":-33.847908,"longitude":151.06671,"timezone":null,"id":"9222554"},"ticketSuppliers":[],"attendanceStatus":null}
