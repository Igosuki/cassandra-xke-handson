Their glorious music combines dissonant lo-fi noise, avant-garde, and psychedelic sounds to warped song structures. Rising out of the same scene that produced Dinosaur Jr, Supreme Dicks were vital contributors to the lo-fi and avant garde genres. The band’s constantly revolving line-up (Lou Barlow was a Dick now and again) centered around Daniel Oxenberg, Jon Shere, Steve Shavel, Mark Hanson, and Jim Spring, whose psychedelic-yet-twangy brand of rock’n'roll came out of the band’s roots at Hampshire College in the Reagan era.<br /><br />Jagjaguar Band Page <a href=\"http://www.jagjaguwar.com/artist.php?name=supremedicks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jagjaguwar.com/artist.php?name=supremedicks</a><br /><br />FB Tour Event <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/317685105018485/317698041683858/?notif_t=plan_mall_activity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/events/317685105018485/317698041683858/?notif_t=plan_mall_activity</a><br /><br /> <br /><br />CHALAQUE<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/chalaque\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.facebook.com/chalaque</a></div>","url":"http://www.last.fm/event/3523438+SUPREME+DICKS+(us)+-+CHALAQUE+(uk)","website":"http://www.arena.co.at/index.php?section=prog_detail&id=4563","attendance":2,"reviews":0,"venue":{"name":"Arena DreiRaum","url":"http://www.last.fm/venue/8876907+Arena+DreiRaum","website":"http://www.arena.co.at","city":"Wien","country":"Austria","street":"Baumgasse 80","postal":"1030","phonenumber":"","latitude":48.187523,"longitude":16.41338,"timezone":null,"id":"8876907"},"ticketSuppliers":[],"attendanceStatus":null}
