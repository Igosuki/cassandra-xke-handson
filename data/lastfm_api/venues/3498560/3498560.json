Confirmed to tour the East Coast of Australia in March 2013 with their ‘Wrecking Ball Tour’. <br /><br />The Wrecking Ball world tour has to date stopped in 18 countries with over 80 shows including several of the longest performances of Springsteen’s career. The tour has earned universal acclaim being called &quot;gigantic&quot; (Rolling Stone), &quot;the stuff of legend&quot; (Irish Independent) and &quot;the greatest live act in the world&quot; (Evening Herald). <br /><br />The LA Times described Springsteen as the “greatest musical performer of our time” and declared the show “perhaps the most inspirational show I’ve witnessed in 30 years of attending thousands of concerts.” <br /><br />The tour, in support of new album ‘Wrecking Ball’ (out now through Sony Music Australia), recently won the 2012 Billboard Touring Awards “Top Draw” Award, in recognition of the year’s top ticket-selling tour. <br /><br />Anticipation has been high for the announcement of this tour and tickets are expected to sell fast.</div>","url":"http://www.last.fm/event/3498560+Bruce+Springsteen+and+the+E+Street+Band","website":"http://premier.ticketek.com.au/shows/show.aspx?sh=BRUCESPR13&v=SSD#.UQhjWidlIfU","attendance":5,"reviews":0,"venue":{"name":"Allphones Arena","url":"http://www.last.fm/venue/9222554+Allphones+Arena","website":"http://allphonesarena.com.au/","city":"Sydney Olympic Park","country":"Australia","street":"Olympic Blvd","postal":"2127","phonenumber":"(02) 8765 4321","latitude":-33.847908,"longitude":151.06671,"timezone":null,"id":"9222554"},"ticketSuppliers":[],"attendanceStatus":null}
